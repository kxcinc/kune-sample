# kune-sample
Sample OCaml repository that vendors dune itself

## Get started
To build this project, use `./kune build` instead of `dune build`.

In general, if you use `./kune` in place of `dune`, the vendored
version of Dune will be used instead of the stock version installed
on your system / OPAM switch.
